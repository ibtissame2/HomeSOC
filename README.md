# 🛡️ HomeSOC - Home Security Operations Center

![HomeSOC Architecture](docs/images/architecture.png)

## 📋 Overview
HomeSOC is an integrated security monitoring system that simulates a real Security Operations Center environment. This project demonstrates practical cybersecurity skills including network monitoring, vulnerability assessment, and SIEM implementation.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Network Monitoring** with packet analysis
- **Port Scanning Detection** and intrusion detection
- **Vulnerability Scanner** with banner grabbing
- **SIEM Dashboard** using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Centralized Alerting System** with JSON logging
- **Dockerized Deployment** for easy setup

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+** with Scapy, Pandas, Requests
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Ubuntu Linux** environment
- **Git** for version control
